# Hash Of File
This program to find Hash of a File


Python program to find the SHA-1 message digest of a file.

Hash functions take an arbitrary amount of data and return a fixed-length bit string.
The output of the function is called the digest message.



In cryptography, SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest â€“ typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long. It was designed by the United States National Security Agency, and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard.

Since 2005 SHA-1 has not been considered secure against well-funded opponents,and since 2010 many organizations have recommended its replacement by SHA-2 or SHA-3. Microsoft, Google, Apple and Mozilla have all announced that their respective browsers will stop accepting SHA-1 SSL certificates by 2017.
